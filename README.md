# Meme Scraper 

## Here is what I did in this project:

### 1. Fetched HTML as a string from a website (input: URL / output: string with all HTML)

### 2. Saved the Source Links from the entire HTML into an array (URLs)

### 3. Sliced the array to only 10 elements (URLs)

### 4. Downloaded the images from the URLs and put them into image folders (did it for each image seperately, I know this was not asked in the project, but didn't find another way )
